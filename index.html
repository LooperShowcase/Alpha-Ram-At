      Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and
      originally released in 2009. The game was created by Markus "Notch"
      Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private
      testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully
      released on November 18, 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb"
      Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling
      video game in history, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140
      million monthly active players as of 2023. Over the years following its
      release, it has been ported to several platforms, including PC, mobile and
      various consoles.

<p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, pixelated, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health), creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly), spectator mode (in which players can fly, go through blocks, and enter the bodies of other players and entities), adventure mode (in which players have to survive without being able to build and place blocks), and hardcore mode (in which the difficulty is set to Hard and dying causes the player to lose their ability to play on that world). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.</p>
